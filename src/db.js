        Daesun Flour Mills Abandoned Silo regeneration plan (2020)
        `,
        content: `Passing by Times Square near Yeongdeungpo Station, you will see an old abandoned factory on your left. The site, w
        hich was built in the 1930s due to industrialization, has long served as a manufacturing company. Over time, this fact
        ory has become a relic of the industrial era, and it has lost its function and remains an empty house alone.
        Residents, workers and visitors near Yeongdeungpo Station still feel nostalgic about the industrial era that passed by
        whenever they passed by. The Times Square shopping mall, a huge new generation building with a single road, is pro
        perly contrasted with the building, making the old factory a more mysterious place.
        
        In Munrae-dong, Yeongdeungpo, many ironworks and textile factories were built in every alley due to the booming ma
        nufacturing industry caused by industrialization in the 1960s. In the 1970s and 1980s, the factory alley in Munrae-dong
        was also in its heyday due to the booming manufacturing industry, but the factory alley was also in decline due to th
        e slump in the manufacturing industry since the 1980s and the financial crisis in the late 1990s.
        Most of the factories were redeveloped in modern times with new functions as residential or commercial areas, but th
        ere are still many factories left undeveloped in every alley, and the Daesun Flour Mills also remained there over time.
        In the 2000s, a youth artist village has been formed in Munrae-dong as young artists gather in low-rent factory alleys,
        and has been reborn as a unique place where manufacturing factories, artists, industry and culture and arts coexist. Th
        e presidential office will also renew its lost function and become a vital part of the city that has been transformed into
        a new function, boldly showing its former appearance, rather than continuing to remain a relic of the industrial age.
        
        To create various facilities and spaces on 18,900 square meters of land, the remaining elements of the original aband
        oned factory facilities will be made the most of. The cylindrical building is a silo (grain storage warehouse), a key facil
        ity of the plant. While maintaining Silo, an iron structure that makes people feel nostalgic, with its huge presence, it tr
        ied to create a complex cultural green space where history and nostalgia can be clearly felt in order to revitalize the
        surrounding city centers as a new landmark.
        The exterior environment is decorated with small residential buildings using abandoned factory waste iron and open sp
        aces such as forests, streams and plazas, creating neighborhood living facilities and viewing spaces together. The mai
        n building was constructed as a public exhibition hall, theater, hall, and other public spaces where visitors could enjoy
        various contents while looking at nature at the center of the land.
        
        In cities in the low-growth era, it was thought that sustainable regeneration was a reasonable solution by reassigning the
        original purpose and function of the past to the lost place, rather than destroying everything and creating new ones.
        This process rediscovers the value of industrial heritage, creating a new functioning space for familiar and old spaces.
        In the space where old things have been regenerated and renewed, there remains a mystery from the old without an
        y new space created without any connection.
        
        The Gallery outside the first floor uses arched windows to give a stable and quiet feeling, and the interior space is s
        upported by cores and columns to maximize the area of use. The interior of the first floor is a huge hypostyle hall d
        ecorated with curved columns, and the SUPPORTING VAULTS holds the light coming inside in a curved shape.
        
        All open spaces sink on the floor, allowing visitors to move at various heights and "float" and experience deeply the
        buildings and the surrounding nature itself. Visitors will be able to enjoy the 360-degree view from different heights. T
        he roof is the most primitive part that shows the concept of the building (silo), creating a new atmosphere when ente
        ring the rooftop garden and attracting attention from far away to the observatory.
        
        The site should be remembered as a hub of workers' lives for a long time, a special place of remembrance for near
        by residents, visitors, and everyone involved in the Yeongdeungpo factory complex, while at the same time playing an
        active pivotal role as a member of an industry in the history of Korea and modern history.
        The huge building will provide a space for people in the city to relax and enjoy various content, and as a local landm
        ark, it will breathe new life into the urban community with its role of making everyone feel the continuity of time that
        has passed naturally. In addition, it is expected that the factory area, which was left unattended and used inefficiently,
        will be revitalized and a complex industrial and cultural hub suitable for the characteristics of Yeongdeungpo, providing
        an urban foundation for urban revitalization and growth in southwestern Seoul.

KEPCO's Daegu headquarters building reversed the symbolism of the existing Korea Electric Power Corporation with a form design that takes into account the public nature and an open grid open to Daegu citizens, and interacted with nature by creating a rich indoor shared space through the inflow of open spaces and green areas. In addition, we planned a new future office building as a place to increase the value of employees' lives, maximize work efficiency, and contribute to the local community to create a creative space for cooperation and communication.

        The new building will provide a space for employees to relax, enjoy various contents, and work, and as a local landmark, it will revitalize the urban community by making everyone who visits feel the sense of space naturally manifested by various hierarchies. In addition, it is expected that the attached spaces inside the site, which were neglected and inefficiently used despite being located in a block where major public institutions gathered, will be reactivated and newly created as an air institution suitable for regional characteristics, laying the urban foundation for urban revitalization and growth in northern Daegu.

        본 계획안은 서로 다른 공공기관이 한곳에 모인 공공기관 ’블록‘ 내 중심부의 거점 역할로서 한국전력공사 대구본부 사옥을 제안하는 프로젝트입니다. 한국전력공사 대구본부 사옥은 공공적 성격을 고려한 형태 디자인과 대구시민에게 열린 오픈 그리드를 담아낸 배치와 내부 공간 디자인으로 기존의 한국전력공사의 상징성을 역전시켜 담아 내었고, 오픈스페이스와 녹지 유입을 통한 풍부한 옥내 공유공간 조성으로 자연과 교감하였습니다. 또한, 협력과 소통의 창의적 공간과 쾌적한 업무공간 형성을 위해 직원들의 삶의 가치를 높이며 근무환경 개선과 업무능률 극대화 및 지역사회 공헌을 위한 장소로 새로운 미래형 사옥을 계획하였습니다.
        
        신사옥은 직원들이 휴식을 취하고 다양한 콘텐츠를 즐기며 업무를 할 수 있는 공간을 제공할 것이며, 지역의 랜드마크로서 방문하는 모두가 다양한 위계에 의해 나타나는 공간감을 자연스럽게 느끼도록 하는 역할로 도시 공동체에 새로운 활력을 불어넣을 것입니다. 또한, 주요 공공기관이 모인 블록에 위치함에도 방치된 채 비효율적으로 이용되던 대지 내부의 부속공간들을 다시 활성화시키고, 지역적 특색에 맞는 공기관으로 새롭게 조성되어 도심 활성화와 대구북부권 성장을 위한 도시기반이 마련될 것으로 기대됩니다.
        
        무엇보다 'MZ 세대'라는 용어의 사용을 통해 클라이언트를 특정화할 수 있었고, 클라이언트가 궁극적으로 원하는 것과 그들의 취향을 가정한 뒤 프로젝트를 착수하였으며, 이를 충족시키기 위해 최선을 다했습니다.`,

        title: `City 2040, Micro Climate Control Center, design for the 4th grade 1st semester. (2022)

        2022 SKYHIVE Skyscraper Challenge / Edition #5 - 1st Prize + BB Student Award`,
        content: `This skyscraper construction project was started based on three questions in the 
        process of resolving the problem of a land, which is controversial about the
        direction of development in the metropolitan city of Daegu, Korea.
        
        Can we design skyscrapers while considering conservation perspective that require
        less development? How will the invisible identity of the isolated natural space
        within the city be architecturally resolved and related to the city? How can we
        avoid designing a huge wall between the city and nature?
        
        This skyscraper suggests the direction of development of the central business
        district from the perspective of preserving existing building complexes. Due to this
        development, the existing complex will be preserved as a natural space freely used
        by people in the city over time. In addition, a modular cultural center that can be
        changed flexibly will be developed together to actively respond to future industries.
        The project continued the tug-of-war between nature-conservation and urban
        development, with a focus on sustainable concepts and green tech to create
        eco-facilities in the city that could be used by people.
        
        Currently, there are two different positions of opinion for the land development
        plan. One is the economic opinion that the land has great economic and commercial
        potential among Daegu's commercial centers and high-rise buildings, so it is
        appropriate to build a massive residential and commercial complex. The second is
        that the development direction of the land should be for the public rather than
        economic purpose and make it a park for people because it faces a nature, which is
        rare in the city. After considering both points of view, I came up with a plan that
        satisfies both opinions, and developed a residential and commercial complex cultural
        center that can have both economic and public characteristics, accommodate a large
        population in the center, and relate it to the park to enjoy nature in the city
        center.
        
        The 2040 plan is a top-level spatial plan in Korea, to shift from the rigid urban
        planning to be flexible that can contain various future urban aspects. The site is an
        important place where major high-rise business facilities are concentrated, and is in
        contact with the road with centrality. The Daegu Court Complex will be relocated
        to another place due to aging in the 2020s, and the current site will lose its
        function, and a new plan is needed according to the current era. The newly
        developed skyscraper should be located in an optimal location, sustainable, minimal
        development, eco-friendly, suggest spatial possibilities to attract new industries to
        restore shrinking jobs, and remain in the city for a long time to present
        development potential to the outside.`,

        일정 간격마다 필요한 곳에 설치될 이 시설은 개념적으로 유사한 버스정류장보다 규모가 훨씬 크며, 기존에 있는 도시와 건물에 적응하며 디자인 되어야 합니다. 이는 효율적인 프로그램과 기능들이 필수적으로 추가되어야 한다는 것을 의미하며, 단순한 구조물이 아닌 도시 속에서 좋은 건축물로 남아야 합니다. 저는 이것을 적응형 포트라고 부르며, 이 연구는 도시와 기존 건물, 사용자에 적응하는 디자인 전략을 모색합니다. 또한 미래 착륙시설의 네트워크를 샌프란시스코에 구축하여 대중들에게 이러한 시스템을 공개하고자 합니다.
       
        적응형 포트의 건축은 우리가 상상하는 미래를 묘사합니다. 공공의 수요가 증가함에 따라 점진적으로 설치될 것이며, 모듈 구조 프레임 워크는 그것을 사용할 사용자, 항공기의 유형, 토지의 조건과 같은 다양한 요소에 따라 요구되는 형태로 디자인됩니다. 적응형 포트는 시민의 이상을 표현할 뿐 아니라, 요구에 의해 생성됨으로써 기능과 건축미학, 프로그램을 융합하는 새로운 유형의 건축물로서 도시에 도입될 것입니다.`,
